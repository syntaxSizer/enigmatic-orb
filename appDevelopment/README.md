### Target Audience

This workshop was prepared as a presentation to Pioneer University as an outreach initiative from Moringa School to grow technology in Africa by sharing knowledge hence it is suitable to any developer who would desire to apply Design thinking or build out not just any application but one that truly serves the user's needs

### Purpose and Approach

As we were preparing content for this workshop our hope was to disrupt thinking of the young developers which makes it essential that you prepare your audience to be open minded and accepting to explore their imaginations to build out a solution. 

The workshop was scheduled for three hours but technical difficulties in setting up the lab left us with two hours to work with which we successfully managed to impact on the audience by grouping them together and emphasizing on collaboration to achive the task which ended with the different groups coming up with wireframes or sketch designs of their ideated solutions.
If you wish, you can create a competitive environment to stimulate the groups to work faster and collaborate more.

For a passive audience you can master the slides beforehand and present to them as you stop to allow for questions or confirm that they are still engaged through a quick recap.

### Gratitudes

I would like to thank the Pioneer community as they were a great audience and for the success of the workshop through their full commitment to learning.
